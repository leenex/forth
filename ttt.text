	Some rules off the top of my head
	
	1. If opponent has 2 adjacent cells, we must place ours in the third
	2. We can place ours if we find a neigbor for it
	3. Two cells are adjacent if 
		3.1 Horizontal: They are neighbors in the array and on the same line
		3.2 Vertical: They are separated by 3 places and in the same column
		3.3 Diagonal: One is number 4 and there is at least one more
